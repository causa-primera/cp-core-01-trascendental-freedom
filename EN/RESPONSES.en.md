# cp-core-01 — Responses to Steelman Objections (v0.3.0 prep)

This document provides paired responses to `OBJECTIONS.en.md` (O1–O5). The aim is not rhetorical victory but boundary-clarification: what Core-01 claims, what it does not claim, and what must be enforced by the apparatus (Core-03) to avoid category mistakes.

## R1 — Response to O1 (proceduralization / normativity smuggled in)

**Concession.** If “transcendental freedom” were merely a checklist of procedures, then it would not ground normativity; it would only decorate it.

**Clarification.** Core-01 does **not** claim to derive normativity from thin air. It claims something narrower and structural:

- Norms may indeed be socially and institutionally sourced.
- However, *responsibility attribution* requires a subject-position capable of **genuine withholding** and **attributable commitment** under those norms.
- That capacity is not “the source of norms”; it is a **condition of possibility** for *owning* a norm-governed stance.

**Where institutions enter.** Institutions can provide:
- rule-sets, sanctions, procedures, due process;
but they cannot replace the logical role of:
- an attributable commitment that can be challenged and revised.

**Operational consequence.** If an environment claims “responsibility exists” while commitments are only pipeline outputs, Core-01 treats that as a category error: *institutional scaffolding without a responsible subject-position is not responsibility, but a simulation of it.*

## R2 — Response to O2 (epiphenomenal suspension)

**Concession.** A subjective feeling of hesitation can be epiphenomenal. If “suspension” is purely phenomenological, it is normatively idle.

**Definition upgrade (anti-epiphenomenal).** In Core-01, **Suspension** is not a feeling; it is an **action at the decision boundary**:
- it interrupts default continuation,
- re-opens the space of alternatives,
- and triggers or reconfigures evaluation criteria.

**Apparatus dependence.** In mediated environments, Suspension is real only if the apparatus ensures:
- no forced default adoption,
- an explicit “stop/withhold” channel,
- and a path to request additional grounds or to refuse the action.

Without those constraints, “suspension” collapses into decorative friction.

**Testable criterion.** Suspension is genuine iff it can change the commitment outcome *without requiring extraordinary heroics* (e.g., quitting the system, legal escalation, or hacking the workflow).

## R3 — Response to O3 (collective agency; no single First Cause)

**Concession.** Many decisions are irreducibly distributed. Treating every decision as the act of a lone individual is empirically and normatively naive.

**Reframing.** “First Cause” in the program is not necessarily a solitary individual. It is a **responsibility-bearing locus**—which may be:
- a role occupant (e.g., a signing officer),
- a committee with defined signatures,
- or an institution that assigns accountable signatories.

**Minimal requirement.** Even in collective contexts, responsibility requires:
- a defined signature topology (who signs what),
- explicit decision boundaries (which layer decides which subpart),
- and answerability channels (how objections travel to the right locus).

**Therefore.** Core-01 is compatible with collective agency, provided the apparatus prevents a common failure mode: *diffusion without ownership* (“everyone contributed, therefore no one answers”).

## R4 — Response to O4 (functional equivalence; anti-essentialism)

**Concession.** If a system were genuinely equivalent across all normatively relevant dimensions—including challenge-responsiveness, revision under reasons, and sanctionability—then a purely stipulative denial of agency would be suspicious.

**Boundary claim (what Core-01 asserts).** Core-01 does not rest on a metaphysical “essence” claim about biology vs machine. It asserts a normative constraint:

- Agency relevant to responsibility includes **non-delegable commitment** under a regime of answerability.
- This is not just output behavior; it includes standing within a practice of attribution, contestation, and sanction.

**Why “functional profile” is not enough by default.**
- A pipeline can mimic reason-responsiveness behaviorally while remaining non-attributable (no one can legitimately hold it responsible, demand justification, impose sanctions, or accept retractions).
- If normativity must be imported via external governance to treat it *as if* it were responsible, then we are back to the “internal defeat” concern: the system’s agency is not grounded by functional role alone.

**Open door (controlled).** Core-01 remains *in principle* open to non-human responsible subjects if (and only if) they can occupy the full responsibility position: attributable commitment + answerability + sanctionability + revision. Until then, treating functional equivalence as sufficient is premature.

## R5 — Response to O5 (regress of endorsement)

**Concession.** If every endorsement requires a further endorsement, an infinite regress threatens.

**Stopping rule.** Core-01 treats commitment (K) as a **basic normative act**—not unjustified, but *not requiring an infinite hierarchy of endorsements*. The regress is avoided by distinguishing:
- **first-order commitment** (I endorse X under reasons R),
from
- **meta-endorsement** (I endorse that I endorse…).

Practical responsibility needs the former; the latter is optional and context-triggered.

**Answerability replaces infinite justification**
