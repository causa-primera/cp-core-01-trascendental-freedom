# cp-core-01 — Responses to Steelman Objections (v0.3.0)

Paired responses to `OBJECTIONS.en.md` (O1–O10). The objective is boundary precision: what Core-01 establishes, what it delegates to apparatus constraints, and what remains domain-specific.

## R1 — Response to O1 (proceduralization / normativity smuggled in)
Core-01 does not claim to generate normativity. It claims a narrower point: responsibility attribution presupposes a subject-position capable of genuine withholding and attributable commitment under norms (whatever their source). Institutions can supply rules and sanctions; they cannot replace owned commitment without simulating responsibility.

## R2 — Response to O2 (epiphenomenal suspension)
Suspension is not a feeling; it is a control act at the decision boundary that can alter outcomes without extraordinary effort. In mediated environments, genuine suspension depends on apparatus properties: explicit stop/withhold channels, anti-default adoption, and re-opening evaluation. If absent, the system fails as a responsibility system.

## R3 — Response to O3 (collective agency)
“First Cause” is a responsibility-bearing locus, not necessarily an individual. Collective agency is supported via signature topology: roles/committees sign defined boundaries, and answerability routes challenges to the accountable locus. The target is anti-diffusion: avoiding “everyone contributed, therefore no one answers.”

## R4 — Response to O4 (functional equivalence)
Core-01 avoids biological essentialism but rejects “output equivalence ⇒ responsibility.” Responsibility requires attributable commitment within practices of contestation, sanctionability, and revision. A pipeline can mimic responsiveness while remaining non-attributable (no legitimate standing for blame, sanction, or retraction). If governance must be imported to treat it “as if” responsible, functional role alone is insufficient.

## R5 — Response to O5 (regress of endorsement)
The regress is blocked by treating commitment as a basic normative act assessed via answerability rather than infinite meta-endorsement. The agent must provide minimum operative reasons and accept structured challenge; ultimate foundations are not required. Revision/retraction under defeat replaces regress with finite, auditable responsibility practice.

## R6 — Response to O6 (criteria underdetermination)
Core-01 requires minimum viable reasons, not complete ex ante formalization. Criteria can be partial and defeasible if they were operative at commitment time and are contestable afterward. The standard is non-arbitrary ownership: the agent can state what counted as reasons/constraints and can revise when those grounds are defeated.

## R7 — Response to O7 (over-demandingness)
This is a scaling constraint, not an elitist universal demand. Responsibility requirements scale with stakes and institutional context. Low-stakes action can satisfy responsibility with minimal PoS; high-stakes domains require stronger apparatus support. The apparatus must reduce burden (accessibility, defaults, UX) so that suspension and reasons capture are feasible for ordinary agents.

## R8 — Response to O8 (normative pluralism)
Core-01 is meta-normative: it specifies conditions for owning a stance under norms, not which norms are correct. Selection among regimes is domain-level (law/politics/ethics). Core-01 adds a constraint: whichever regime is invoked, commitment must be attributable and answerable within contestation, and outputs must not become binding by default.

## R9 — Response to O9 (reliability trade-off)
Instrumental superiority does not substitute for responsibility. The framework allows high-performing instruments while preserving identifiable responsible loci and preventing silent adoption. Time-critical contexts can use emergency delegation modes with explicit logging and post-hoc answerability (review, revision, sanctionability).

## R10 — Response to O10 (power and structural injustice)
Decisive as a design constraint: signature must not launder coercion. PoS must include (where relevant) voluntariness/optionality checks: meaningful alternatives, feasibility of refusal, and constraints/coercion markers. Domain repos (law/politics) will formalize these safeguards; Core-01 insists that “ownership” requires a genuine boundary, not forced compliance dressed as commitment.
