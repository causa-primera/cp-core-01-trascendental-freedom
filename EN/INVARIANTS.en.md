# cp-core-01 — Invariants (v0.3.0 prep)

These invariants define what must remain true for Core-01’s account of transcendental freedom to support responsibility attribution under automation.

---

## I1 — Irreducibility of genuine suspension
A responsible subject-position must retain the capacity to **withhold** at the decision boundary. Suspension cannot be fully replaced by defaults, automation, or mere friction.

## I2 — Non-delegability of normative commitment
Commitment (normative signature) is attributable only to a responsible subject (person/role/committee). Instrumental systems can propose, but cannot “own” commitments.

## I3 — Discontinuity against automatic continuation
The system must preserve the possibility of interrupting “continuity automatic” such that the next step is not implied by inertia. Responsibility requires a controllable break in continuation.

## I4 — Decision-boundary legibility
For any commitment, it must be possible to state what was decided, what alternatives existed, and which constraints applied. Without boundary legibility, ownership becomes fiction.

## I5 — Minimum viable reasons (criteria traceability)
Evaluation must be anchored in operative criteria that can be stated and contested. Full transparency is not required; contestability is.

## I6 — Answerability channel (contestability)
The framework must include a channel through which objections can re-open suspension and evaluation, forcing revision or explicit reaffirmation.

## I7 — Anti-substitution constraint
No output of a Second Cause may be treated as a First-Cause commitment without an explicit appropriation step (Proof of Signature).
