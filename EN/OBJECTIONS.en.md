# cp-core-01 — Steelman Objections (v0.3.0 prep)

These objections target the core claims about transcendental freedom as a necessary condition for normative responsibility under automation.

## O1 — The “proceduralization” objection (normativity smuggled in)
Even if you define freedom as Suspension→Evaluation→Commitment (S→E→K), the account may merely rename a set of procedures. Normative authority still seems to come from outside (social practices, law, institutions). If so, “transcendental freedom” is not doing grounding work—it's a procedural wrapper around externally sourced normativity.

## O2 — The “epiphenomenal suspension” objection
Suspension may be psychologically real but normatively idle: a subject can experience withholding while the decisive causal work is done by automatic processes (habits, priors, environment, system defaults). If suspension does not change the decision boundary in a principled way, it cannot serve as the required condition for responsibility.

## O3 — The “collective agency” objection (no single First Cause)
Many modern decisions are irreducibly distributed across teams, institutions, and technical infrastructures. If responsibility is structurally collective, the insistence on a singular First Cause misdescribes the phenomenon. The theory risks forcing an individual signature onto decisions that are actually produced by organizational and infrastructural agency.

## O4 — The “functional equivalence” objection (anti-essentialism about agency)
If two systems are behaviorally and functionally equivalent in all normatively relevant respects (including responsiveness to reasons, counterfactual sensitivity, revisions under challenge), then denying agency to one system appears to be an essentialist stipulation. Why is “subjecthood” not just a functional profile plus governance?

## O5 — The “regress of endorsement” objection
If commitment requires an attributable “signature,” what authorizes the signature itself? If endorsement must be endorsed, the account risks an infinite regress. If endorsement is taken as primitive, then the theory may be asserting a brute fact (“the subject just owns it”) rather than offering a workable grounding condition.
