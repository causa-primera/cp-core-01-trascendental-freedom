# cp-core-03 — Argument Map (v0.3.0)

## C
A system preserves responsibility under automation iff it implements an apparatus enforcing I1–I6 via boundary legibility, PoS, traceability, contestability, and signature topology. (G1–G4, G6–G15, G18–G20)

## Premises
P1 Outputs ≠ owned commitments. (G7, G10, G18)  
P2 Ownership requires identifiable accountable locus. (G6, G12, G13)  
P3 Automation pushes default adoption. (G17)  
P4 Default adoption compresses suspension. (G8, G3, G17)  
P5 Compression yields substitution. (G18, G10)  
P6 Therefore boundaries must be explicit and legible. (G3, G4)  
P7 Legibility requires interface constraints. (G5)  
P8 Externalization displaces evaluation into instruments. (G16, G9)  
P9 Without traceability, contestability collapses. (G15, G14)  
P10 Therefore traceability is necessary. (G15)  
P11 PoS ties boundary+reasons+answerability+revision. (G11, G3, G15, G12, G22)  
P12 PoS doesn’t require full explainability. (G11)  
P13 Distributed systems require signature topology. (G19)  
P14 Governance supports but cannot replace PoS. (G20, G11)  
P15 Objections must trigger review/revision. (G14, G22)  
P16 Emergency modes must be bounded and audited. (G21, G18)

## Therefore
C.
