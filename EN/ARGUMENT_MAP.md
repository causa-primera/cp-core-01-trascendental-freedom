## Main conclusion (C)
**C:** Responsibility attribution under automation requires **transcendental freedom** as a normative-structural condition: the preservation of **genuine suspension (S)**, **owned evaluation (E)**, and **attributable commitment (K)**, protected against **Second-Cause substitution** by **decision-boundary legibility** and **Proof of Signature (PoS)**. (G1–G6, G10, G14–G18)

## Premises (numbered; glossary-linked)
**P1.** Responsibility attribution presupposes a distinction between instrumental outputs and owned commitments. (G5, G7, G13, G14)  
**P2.** Owned commitments require a responsible locus capable of S→E→K as owned acts. (G2, G3, G4, G5, G12)  
**P3.** Automation tends to induce automatic continuation and to compress genuine suspension unless explicitly constrained. (G3, G10)  
**P4.** Where suspension is compressed, commitment becomes implied by default adoption rather than owned appropriation. (G5, G10, G14)  
**P5.** Externalization of evaluation to instruments makes substitution likely: outputs are treated as if they carried normative authority. (G11, G13, G14)  
**P6.** A commitment is imputable only if the decision boundary is legible: what was decided, alternatives, and constraints are explicitly delineated. (G7, G16)  
**P7.** Responsibility in distributed settings requires a signature topology: each decision boundary maps to accountable signatories (roles/committees), preventing diffusion. (G12, G21)  
**P8.** Contestability is a necessary condition of responsible ownership: commitments must be challengable in structured form. (G6, G18)  
**P9.** Contestability requires criteria traceability: minimum viable reasons must be retrievable for challenge and review. (G8, G17, G18)  
**P10.** PoS is the minimal apparatus step that prevents substitution: boundary + operative criteria + acceptance of answerability + revision channel. (G15, G16, G17, G6, G20)  
**P11.** PoS does not require full transparency of instruments; it requires that the responsible locus can appropriate and defend (or revise) the commitment under challenge. (G15, G6, G17, G20)  
**P12.** Therefore, transcendental freedom is not a metaphysical claim but a normative-structural constraint ensuring S→E→K remains non-delegable at the point of commitment. (G1, G2, G3, G5, G11)

## Inference steps
**S1.** From P1–P2: responsibility requires owned commitments grounded in S→E→K. (G2–G5, G7)  
**S2.** From P3–P5: automation creates systematic pressure toward default adoption and substitution. (G10, G11, G14)  
**S3.** From P6–P11: decision-boundary legibility + PoS + contestability + traceability are necessary constraints to preserve ownership. (G15–G18, G20–G22)  
**S4.** Therefore C.
