# Argument Map (v0.1) — Transcendental Freedom

## A. Target conclusion
**C:** Freedom (as a three-moment normative structure: Suspension → Evaluation → Commitment) is a condition of possibility for reason, where reason is understood as imputable normativity (answerability under reasons).

---

## B. Definitions (dependencies)
- **D1 Reason (strict):** the capacity to take considerations as *reasons* (normative force), evaluate under a criterion of correctness, and issue commitments imputable to a subject (normative signature).
- **D2 Freedom (relevant):** the capacity to enact the three moments:
  - **S** Suspension (genuine withholding; opening a normative question),
  - **E** Evaluation (selection under a criterion that purports to be correct),
  - **K** Commitment (normative signature: ownership/answerability for the selection).
- **D3 Imputability:** the property by which a commitment can be attributed to a subject who can be asked to justify, retract, repair, or apologize as author of the commitment.
- **D4 Normativity:** the space of reasons where predicates like correct/incorrect, justified/unjustified apply (not reducible to causal description alone).

(Each definition is expanded operationally in `GLOSSARY.md`.)

## C. Premises (transcendental structure)

### C1. Reasoning practices presuppose normativity
**P1:** Our practices of reasoning (personal, scientific, legal, institutional) treat some outputs as correct/incorrect and justified/unjustified.  
**P2:** These normative predicates are not merely descriptive labels for behavior; they function as standards that can be demanded, contested, and revised.  
**P3:** Therefore, reason-as-reason (strict) presupposes normativity (D4) rather than mere output production.

### C2. Normativity presupposes answerability (imputability)
**P4:** Standards of correctness are binding only insofar as someone (a subject) can be held to them (answerability).  
**P5:** Answerability requires imputability (D3): there must be an author of commitments who can be asked to justify/retract/repair.  
**P6:** Therefore, normativity in the strict sense presupposes imputable commitment (normative signature).

### C3. Imputable commitment presupposes the three moments (freedom)
**P7:** A commitment is imputable only if it is not merely the endpoint of automatic continuation, but an act that could have been withheld in the relevant context.  
**P8:** The possibility of withholding is Suspension (S): opening the normative question (“should I accept/endorse this?”).  
**P9:** A commitment is not intelligible as commitment without Evaluation (E): selection under some criterion purporting to be correct.  
**P10:** A commitment is not intelligible as imputable without Commitment (K): the normative signature that makes the subject answerable for the selection.  
**P11:** Therefore, imputable commitment presupposes the three-moment structure S→E→K, i.e., freedom in the relevant sense (D2).

### C4. Therefore: freedom is a condition of possibility for reason
**P12:** Reason (strict) presupposes normativity (P1–P3).  
**P13:** Normativity (strict) presupposes imputable commitment (P4–P6).  
**P14:** Imputable commitment presupposes freedom (S→E→K) (P7–P11).  
**C:** Therefore, freedom (S→E→K) is a condition of possibility for reason (strict).

## D. Clarifications (scope)
**SC1:** This argument is not an empirical claim about intelligence/performance.  
**SC2:** It targets the normative status of reason: what must be in place for “reason” to be intelligible as reason, not merely as reliable output.

---

## E. Refutation conditions (defeat criteria)
The conclusion would require revision if one could establish any of the following without remainder:

**R1:** Imputable commitment (normative signature) can exist without Suspension (no genuine withholding).  
**R2:** Evaluation under correctness can exist without any subject capable of answerability.  
**R3:** Normativity-as-imputability reduces completely to descriptive/causal facts.

(These become concrete in `TESTS.md` and `INVARIANTS.md`.)
