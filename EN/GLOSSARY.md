Constraints/interfaces/records preserving ownership under automation. **Not:** a policy manual.

## G2 Apparatus method
Design discipline enforcing invariants for responsibility.

## G3 Decision boundary

## G4 Boundary legibility
Boundaries are identifiable and stable across stakeholders.

## G5 Interface constraint
UI/UX requirements preserving real suspension and choice.

## G6 First Cause (normative locus)
Accountable signatory (person/role/committee).

## G7 Second Cause (instrumental)
Outputs without ownership.

## G8 Suspension (S)
Genuine withholding. **Not:** friction/delay.

## G9 Evaluation (E)
Criterion-guided selection under constraints.

## G10 Commitment / signature (K)

## G11 Proof of Signature (PoS)
Boundary + reasons + answerability + revision channel. **Not:** full explainability.

## G12 Answerability
Standing to respond to objections and consequences.

## G13 Sanctionability
Consequences attachable to accountable locus.

## G14 Contestability

## G16 Externalization (delegation boundary)
Delegation displacing First-Cause functions.

## G17 Automatic continuation
Default adoption implying commitment.

## G18 Second-Cause substitution

## G19 Signature topology
Mapping boundaries to signatories; prevents diffusion.

## G20 Governance layer
