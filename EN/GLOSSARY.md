# Glossary (v0.1) — Transcendental Freedom

This glossary is operational: each entry includes (i) usage conditions and (ii) boundary/counterexample notes.

---

## 1) Reason (strict)
**Definition:** Capacity to treat considerations as reasons (normative force), evaluate under a criterion of correctness, and issue commitments imputable to a subject (normative signature).  
**Use when:** you mean *normative status*, not mere reliability or problem-solving.  
**Not:** “reason” as any successful inference engine or predictor.

---

## 2) Normativity
**Definition:** Space in which correct/incorrect, justified/unjustified apply as standards that can be demanded, contested, revised.  
**Use when:** correctness is not reducible to “it worked” but invokes standards.  
**Boundary:** mere causal regularity or optimization without answerability is not yet normativity (in the strict sense used here).

---

## 3) Imputability (answerability)
**Definition:** Property by which a commitment can be attributed to a subject who can be asked to justify, retract, repair, or apologize as author of it.  
**Use when:** responsibility and justification are in play.  
**Counterexample:** “the system said so” where no one can be asked to justify beyond pointing to the system.

---

## 4) Commitment (normative signature)
**Definition:** An owned endorsement that binds the subject (even if revisable), generating obligations of justification and repair if wrong.  
**Use when:** the subject *stands behind* a judgement.  
**Not:** mere output emission or post-hoc ratification without real possibility of withholding.

---

## 5) Suspension (genuine withholding)
**Definition:** Interrupting automatic continuation to open a normative question (“should I accept/endorse this?”) in a context where one could proceed automatically.  
**Use when:** the withholding is for normative reasons (not due to incapacity).  
**Counterexample:** hesitation from confusion or lack of data that vanishes once data arrives (pure information deficit).

---

## 6) Evaluation
**Definition:** Selection under a criterion that purports to be correct (even if contestable), i.e., “this is better/worse for a reason.”  
**Use when:** you can point to a standard (explicit or reconstructible) that can be challenged.  
**Counterexample:** choosing purely by habit or impulse without any appeal to correctness (unless later endorsed as commitment).

---

## 7) Criterion (standard of correctness)
**Definition:** A standard invoked in justification that distinguishes correct/incorrect and can be contested and revised.  
**Use when:** you want to separate reasons from causes.  
**Boundary:** “criterion” is not just a scalar reward unless it is treated as correctness-apt within a normative practice.

---

## 8) Automatic continuation
**Definition:** Any transition/output that occurs without a genuine possibility of withholding in the relevant context; the path of inertia.  
**Use when:** diagnosing “mere production” vs “judgement.”  
**Counterexample:** a pause that is itself an automatic subroutine (a delay) with no normative question opened.

---

## 9) Externalization
**Definition:** Delegation of operations (search, drafting, simulation, enumeration) to external systems, while preserving the human locus of normative signature.  
**Use when:** distinguishing tool-use from agency transfer.  
**Not:** treating external outputs as commitments without signature (that is agency-loss, not neutral externalization).

---

## 10) Agency (strong sense)
**Definition:** Capacity for self-binding normative action: genuine suspension, evaluation under correctness, and imputable commitment (signature).  
**Use when:** you mean “subject of commitments,” not just “goal-directed behavior.”  
**Counterexample:** a system with sophisticated behavior whose norms and liabilities remain entirely assigned/borne by external agents.
