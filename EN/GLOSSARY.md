## G1 — Transcendental freedom
A structural capacity required for responsibility attribution: the ability to interrupt automatic continuation and to commit under norms in an attributable way.

**Boundary note:** not a metaphysical thesis about indeterminism. It is normative-structural and can be compatible with deterministic causal stories.

## G2 — Strong agency
Agency sufficient for responsibility attribution, minimally requiring S→E→K as owned acts.

## G3 — Suspension (S)
Genuine withholding at the decision boundary that can alter the course of action without extraordinary effort.

**Not:** mere delay, friction, or phenomenological hesitation.

## G4 — Evaluation (E)
Criterion-guided selection among reasons/grounds under constraints, uncertainty, and trade-offs.

## G5 — Commitment / Normative signature (K)
An attributable stance that can be owned, challenged, revised, and sanctioned.

**Boundary note:** “signature” is not a biometric mark; it is a responsibility-bearing appropriation step.

## G6 — Answerability
The standing to be required to respond to objections and consequences for a commitment.

## G7 — Imputability
Normative assignability of a decision/action to a responsible locus (person/role/committee).

## G8 — Reason (strict sense)
Normatively weight-bearing grounds (not merely causal explanations). Reasons can be offered in justification and contested.

## G9 — Normativity
The “ought-space”: obligations, permissions, prohibitions, and authoritative reasons.

## G10 — Automatic continuation
A default/inertial mode where actions proceed such that commitment is implied without explicit ownership.

## G11 — Externalization (delegation boundary)
Delegating evaluation/selection to instruments in a way that risks replacing the subject’s own responsibility functions.

## G12 — First Cause (normative)
A responsibility-bearing locus capable of S→E→K as owned acts (may be individual or collective via signature topology).

## G13 — Second Cause (instrumental)
A transmissive/operationa
